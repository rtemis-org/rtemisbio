Read \code{Xt} object from JSON file

\details{
Note that factors saved under \code{group} are written as character by \link{write_Xtjson} and
when they are read back in, they are converted back to factors using \link{factor}. This means that
the levels will be set alphabetically. If needed, reorder them after reading in the JSON file
using \link{factor}.
